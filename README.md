# Dynamic Coattention Network for Question Answering 

## Status:
Implementation of  https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01604
Will try to update this repository as an end to end model for dynamic coattention network in near future to provide command line training and testing.

## Requirements:
Python 2.7.x
Tensorflow (1.3.0)
Numpy 1.13.1

## Data
SQuaD Dataset 
data/ : folder contains the embeddings, and whole dataset [train and validation dataset]
