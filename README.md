# Dynamic Coattention Network for Question Answering 

## Status:
Implementation of  https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01604 \n
Will try to update this repository as an end to end model for dynamic coattention network in near future to provide command line training and testing.

## Requirements:
Python 2.7.x \n
Tensorflow (1.3.0) \n
Numpy 1.13.1 \n

## Data
SQuaD Dataset[https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/] \n
